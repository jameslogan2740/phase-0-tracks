# Git Definitions - James Logan

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control? A: the task of keeping a software system consisting of many versions and configurations well organized. Why is it useful? A: It is useful so after all files have been changed, you can eventually merge them together. 

* What is a branch and why would you use one? A: Git object data for multiple commits. A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of these commits. The default branch name in Git is master. As you initially make commits, you're given a master branch that points to the last commit you made. Every time you commit, it moves forward automatically. 

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message? A: records changes to the repository. A good commit message is leaving a detailed message of what changes you made. 

* What is a merge conflict? A: It's basically an error when you attempt to merge a file that's non existsant. It can also be an error when you attempt to pull from a non existant branch.
